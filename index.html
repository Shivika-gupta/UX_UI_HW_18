        <p class="about_me">
            I believe that the best designs meet the users needs by offering them more than what they are looking for. 
            I am very passionate about my work and put my totality into everything that I do.Currently working in digital marketing, 
            I find myself using my graphic design skills to create aesthetic assets for websites and social media. 
            I use my copywriting skills to attract my audience and promote services effectively.</p>
            <p>
            I chose to transition to UX Design because my background in Marketing made me realise how much I enjoy designing and conceptualising websites 
            and that I wanted to focus on developing user journeys according to human behavior.</p>
            <p>I am a very radiant person, full of energy and always positive. I am quite patient and 
              I spend a lot of time on my self- growth and meditation. It helps me ground myself and be a better human. </p>

            <p>
                I specialize in solving my users’ problems by devising unique
                solutions that enhance their overall user experience. My skills
                include branding, designing user-friendly websites and applications,
                team working, and applying a human centered approach to solving
                issues. I use the design thinking process to create unique website
                and applications by identifying the challenges that users face.

            <p style="padding-bottom: 4%;">
                Designing for me is like meditation. Once I start designing something,
                I find myself completely connected to the process of creating the user
                journey. I always ask myself: “What would I want if I was the user?”
                “Would this solve my needs?”. What might work for one user.. might not
                work for another. Hence, I believe user testing is an equally
                important part of UX/UI designing.

            <p>           
               The Australian Institue of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies (AIATSIS) is a government agency 
            website that focuses on conserving and 
            exploring the unique culture of the native communities in Australia. 
            The goal of this project was to redesign the homepage and navigation infrastructure of 
            the website in order to make it more user-friendly.

              The aim of this project was to redesign the website for Edgars Mission, a non-for-profit organization that protects farm animals against cruelty. 
              The project involved incorporating the design thinking process to enhance the overall user experience, thereby encouraging users to make donations, 
              sponsor and adopt animals through the platform.
